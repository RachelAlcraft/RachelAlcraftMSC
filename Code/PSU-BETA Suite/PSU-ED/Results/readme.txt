To save space only the summary results and the first sample are included.
(Full results directory include results for every sample.)

The convention in the results directoy is that 0_ is a superposition and 1_ etc is each sample. 
The total number is given, so 1_50 means first out of 50.

There are 2 matrices are produced, standard and a log to increase contrast. The log matrices/images have X on the end.
