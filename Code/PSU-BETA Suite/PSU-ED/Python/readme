The entrance point is densityPSU.py
Normalised density matrices are calculated and saved to file.
This is only done once per pdb so subsequent uses are faster.

External library: https://pdb-eda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
Also uses BioPython

Note that these libraries require pdb files and electron density files, and will download them if they need to. This can be slow at the outset.
